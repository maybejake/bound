**Bound!** is a simple datapack that adds the new _Bound_ enchantment for **boots**! This enchantment allows the player to jump again in the air by pressing the jump key!

The Bound enchantment has levels, with Bound I giving the player one extra jump and Bound III giving them 3! It is also exclusive with Feather Falling, so choose wisely!

Bound enchantment books can be obtained from [Ominous Vaults](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ominous_Vault) in Trial Chambers, and will randomly drop with Bound I to Bound III

# Performance
This datapack generally **does not work well on servers**. If you have low ping, it will feel just fine! But as ping gets higher, the jumps become more and more unpredictable

# Thanks
Thanks to [player motion](https://modrinth.com/datapack/player_motion) for the motion code!
